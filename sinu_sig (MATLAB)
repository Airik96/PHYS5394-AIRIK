THE FOLLOWING CODE IS MEANT TO BE USED IN THE MATLAB SOFTWARE:
%This will be an attempt at plotting a sinusoidal signal
%PHYS 5394-90L
%AIRIK SANCHEZ

%set up the frequency of the signal
signal = 180;
frequency = signal/60;

repeat = 6;
f = repeat/60;
%this frequency will act as the true frequency for our signal, set up time
%variable that can manipulate signal length

time = 1;

%most wave functions have some kind of amplitude, introduce variable A to 
%control this
A = 1;

%begin signal construction
ind = (1/frequency):(time*repeat*1/f);
sin_sig = A*sin(2*pi*f*ind);

%plot sin_sig and check if accurate
plot(sin_sig)
